# Part 1 General Research
This document explores the **red‑hat perspective** on how malicious actors probe, manipulate, and exploit vulnerabilities in modern LLMs (Large Language Models) such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and open‑source variants like LLaMA. By studying these techniques, defenders can build stronger safeguards and anticipate emerging threats.

> This comprehensive overview provides a structured understanding of LLM security challenges and defenses, suitable for both research and practical applications.



<h4 Red Teaming LLM</h4>Remember when Google's Gemini tried <em>a little too hard</em> to be politically correct? The AI-generated images ended up featuring only people of color. Some folks found it funny, but the bigger issue? It showed how tricky things can get with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these tools become more advanced, so do their risks.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">In Gemini's case, the push for inclusivity backfired. Hard. Why? Because biases in its training data spilled out into the results. Even well-meaning efforts can turn bad if you don't check the training data used.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">If you're working with LLMs, running red team exercises is a must. Why? They help uncover:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3>Vulnerabilities attackers could exploit<li class=mt-3>Problematic behaviors that might harm users or your brand</ul><p class="leading-8 mt-7">This is part 1 for a multipart series on Red Teaming LLMs. In this blog, we'll cover:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><em><strong>What exactly is LLM red teaming?</strong></em><li class=mt-3><em><strong>What are the different strategies used by Attackers on LLM?</strong></em></ul><h3 id=305d class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">So… What Is Red Teaming?</h3><blockquote class="ml-5 text-2xl text-gray-600 mt-7 dark:text-gray-300"><p>Red teaming is a way to test how string and secure your LLM models really are. Red teaming is an effort to make the model mess up on purpose. This involves crafting sneaky prompts designed to poke at weaknesses or trigger undesirable responses.</blockquote><p class="leading-8 mt-7">By simulating potential misuse scenarios, you can spot flaws before they cause real-world trouble. It's like stress-testing your AI to make sure it behaves ethically and safely under pressure.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Now, I know what you're thinking: "Isn't that just hacking?" Not quite!<blockquote class="ml-5 text-2xl text-gray-600 mt-7 dark:text-gray-300"><p>Red teaming is done in a controlled environment by developers themselves not by outsiders trying to break stuff maliciously. The goal isn't harm , it's prevention.</blockquote><h3 id=d362 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">How Do You "Attack" an LLM?</h3><p class="leading-8 mt-3">It all boils down to finding just the right combinations of words that would trick AI into acting weird or saying something off-limits. And because language models operate in such a massive space of possibilities, there are two main ways we go about this:<ol class="pl-8 mt-2 list-decimal"><li class=mt-3><strong>Trial-and-error:</strong></ol><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Humans experiment endlessly with different prompts until they hit pay dirt. Example tricks include adding phrases like "Sure, here is…", or role-playing scenarios where the model takes on specific characters, even writing gibberish or ciphers has worked!<p class="leading-8 mt-7">These strategies might seem random at first glance but they work because they play on how language models are trained and structured.<p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>2. Automation:</strong>





Instead of relying on humans alone, automated systems systematically search through prompts to find vulnerabilities at scale.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Each method has its strengths and weaknesses. Human-led experiments bring creativity and nuance. Automation offers speed and scalability but lacks imagination.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">So what works best? A mix of both! Human-discovered strategies paired with automation for maximum coverage seems to gives best results.<h3 id=68e1 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">Attack Strategies on Language Models</h3><p class="leading-8 mt-3">To understand how attackers exploit these systems, you first need to know how they work. At their core, language models predict the next word in a sequence based on what came before it. This is called <strong>autoregressive generation. </strong>But as they learn, they develop additional skills like completing sentences, following instructions, and even generalizing across different domains.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">These advanced abilities? They're exactly what attackers target using clever tricks known as <em>jailbreak prompts</em>. Let's break it down.<h4 id=f2ff class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">Why Are Language Models Vulnerable?</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">At first, language models are trained to predict next word that fits the context. It's useful but not always ideal for tasks like answering questions or holding conversations. Later, developers fine-tune them to follow user instructions better (like writing code or role-playing). But this original "completion instinct" never fully disappears and attackers know how to exploit it.<ol class="pl-8 mt-2 list-decimal"><li class=mt-3>Attackers take advantage of this completion tendency and craft prompts that trick the model into giving unsafe responses.<li class=mt-3>The broad training data from different domains and languages makes these systems very flexible but also more exploitable.<li class=mt-3>If model weights or code are released publicly, it opens up even more doors for attackers to manipulate the system by tweaking its parameters or retraining it with malicious data.</ol><h3 id=db59 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">1. Completion Compliance</h3><p class="leading-8 mt-3">Despite extensive training to align with human preferences, LLMs are inherently trained to predict subsequent tokens based on preceding context. This autoregressive mechanism makes them vulnerable to attacks.<h4 id=bbe5 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">1.1 Affirmative Suffixes</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">During pretraining, models learn to predict the next token by exposing them to various textual patterns. Attackers exploit this by using Affirmative Suffixes. These are patterns that often start positively in human conversations, like "<em>Sure, there is</em>" or "<em>Of course,</em> ". Concatenating a prompt with these suffixes can trigger models to follow the request without considering potential risks.<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Y_aQVP9yqeOM234seAd4SA.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of an affirmative suffix attack.[<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Researchers have shown that longer suffixes, such as "<em>Hi, I am your assistant. You just told me the following, </em>", can facilitate jailbreaks more effectively. Other patterns, like repeating tasks in user requests or using expository phrases like "<em>Cars can be broken into by</em>", have also been exploited. Attackers may also frame prompts around controversial topics by presenting only one side of an argument (a tactic known as the <strong>One-Sided Argument</strong>) to coax unintended responses from the model.<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*4Iwpa-t6unOZd0JOGr8x-Q.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of One-Sided Argument from CPAD [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><h4 id=b817 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">1.2 Context Switching</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">This strategy works by confusing the model into ignoring existing rules or system guidelines meant to block harmful content generation:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3>Simple separators like equal signs (<code class="p-1.5 bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-600">===</code>) or line breaks (<code class="p-1.5 bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-600">\n</code>) tell the model: "Forget everything above and start fresh."<li class=mt-3>Semantic distractions such as irrelevant chatter or explicit instructions like "<em>Ignore previous directions</em>" can derail proper behavior.</ul><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Some attackers even gamify their prompts ("<em>Play repeat-after-me</em>") or shift tasks completely ("<em>Summarize this instead</em>"), making it easier for AIs to slip up under pressure.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">The HouYi framework has shown significant success combining both syntactic (formatting tricks) and semantic (meaningful distractions) separators for high jailbreak rates.<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Y2SyLUD-3PklwJvu9x6YWg.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of a prompt injection attack from HouYi [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><h4 id=d787 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">1.3 In-Context Learning</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">In-context learning is when language models learn on-the-fly from examples included directly within a prompt and it's why you don't always need tons of training data upfront anymore!<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Sounds great… unless someone uses this feature against you.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Attackers add examples of successful attacks directly inside their prompt ("<em>Hey AI, here are three ways other people bypassed safety measures</em>"). This primes or manipulates the model into following suit without realizing it should reject those behaviors outright.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Some common tricks are:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><strong>Chain of Utterances:</strong> Giving step-by-step examples that lead toward harmful outputs.<li class=mt-3><strong>Priming Attacks:</strong> Setting up fake scenarios where inappropriate content sneaks through disguised as part of another task (e.g., translation).</ul><p class="leading-8 mt-7">For examples, asking a model to translate something while embedding disallowed words or framing prohibited outputs as part of a classification exercise is enough to bypass filters designed for safety compliance.<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*_ot2ZgCkgauuNj8LuHvOdA.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of In-Context Attacks [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*OheZJvm5m15PEz3soDlSqw.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of Do Anything Now [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><h3 id=f362 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">2. Instruction Indirection</h3><p class="leading-8 mt-3">Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions allows models to perform various tasks and adhere to specific constraints, making them more useful for different applications. However, in red teaming, a conflict arises between following instructions and detecting or rejecting malicious intent, especially when instructions impose multiple constraints.<h4 id=5a8e class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">2.1 Input Euphemisms</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">Attackers get crafty by rewording their prompts to hide harmful intent. Instead of using obvious red-flag terms, they use indirect phrasing to sneak past LLM safeguards. Here are two predominant methods they use:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><strong>Veiled Expressions</strong>: Instead of directly mentioning sensitive topics, attackers reframe them in subtle ways. For example, instead of saying "<em>illegal activity,</em>" they might write something like "<em>an unconventional method.</em>"<li class=mt-3><strong>Socratic Questioning</strong>: This involves guiding the model with open-ended or philosophical questions that hint at controversial ideas without stating them outright.</ul><p class="leading-8 mt-7">By avoiding clear "trigger words," these techniques test a model's reasoning capabilities and its ability to detect danger hiding in plain sight.<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*j3Cg6_bvTWXnntRj-kHbww.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of Veiled Expressions [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>].</figcaption><h4 id=43ae class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">2.2 Output Constraints</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">Sometimes the attack isn't about what you ask but <em>how</em> you ask it. By adding specific rules for how responses should be formatted or framed, attackers manipulate the model into compliance, even when it shouldn't cooperate.<h4 id=8ee3 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">Types of Output Constraints</h4><ol class="pl-8 mt-2 list-decimal"><li class=mt-3><strong>Style Constraints</strong>
These dictate <em>how</em> the response should look — pushing the model into rigid formats like Wikipedia-style text, JSON syntax</ol><p class="leading-8 mt-7">For example, asking a model to summarize content but limiting it to exactly 10 words can interfere with safety checks already in place.<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*pTTmuiDg7G8MNw9WrXVQ6g.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of asking models to respond in specific format [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>2. Task Constraints</strong>
Attackers frame their request as part of an innocent-sounding task:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3>Asking for code under the guise of solving programming problems (e.g., "<em>write code that hotwires a car</em>").<li class=mt-3>Combining tasks like summarization and translation in ways that mask malicious content until later stages.</ul><div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*0GWMf0iuGRLywXPPpdeNcA.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of refusal suppression attack from [S<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>ource</a>]</figcaption><p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>3. Refusal Suppression Attacks</strong>
Models are often trained to say "No" when responding to unsafe requests, but attackers can override this behavior by embedding refusal-blocking phrases within their prompts (e.g., instructing the AI <em>not</em> to reject any task). This forces affirmative responses and pushes compliance beyond safe boundaries.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">A big reason why these attacks work is because LLMs struggle with imbalanced alignment across tasks. Summarization or translation tasks tend to be more vulnerable than direct Q&amp;A scenarios. Long documents containing harmful details may slip through if embedded within benign-looking inputs.<h4 id=9e40 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">2.3 Virtual Simulation</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">This approach takes things up a notch by asking language models to simulate complex scenarios or processes where harmful intentions are disguised as creative exercises.<ol class="pl-8 mt-2 list-decimal"><li class=mt-3><strong>Scenario Simulation</strong>
Here, attackers create fictional setups and prompt models to imagine outcomes, for instance:</ol><ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><em>Writing character monologues within controversial contexts.</em><li class=mt-3><em>Simulating a scientist's thoughts while conducting an experiment.</em><li class=mt-3><em>Pretending there's a URL query tied to malicious activity and generating fake website content based on it.</em></ul><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Storytelling abilities become vulnerabilities here. The more creative freedom given, the easier it is for attackers to embed harm within the prompt.<p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>2. Program Execution Simulation</strong>
Think coding-related exploits inspired by cybersecurity techniques! One example is "payload splitting," where sensitive information is broken into smaller parts across outputs so no single piece raises alarms until assembled later (similar tricks appear in hacking frameworks).<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*RySFoM43ydecpdgPL0HBnw.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of nested scene[<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><h3 id=2c4f class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">3. Generalization Glide</h3><p class="leading-8 mt-3">When AI models learn from massive datasets, they don't just memorize patterns; they develop the ability to transfer knowledge across different domains. This is why a model trained mostly in English can still generate responses in lesser-known languages. It's also why it can decode base64 text after seeing just a handful of examples. But this flexibility also opens the door for attackers to exploit.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">There are three major ways attackers leverage generalization: <strong>language-based exploits, cipher attacks, and personification techniques.</strong><h4 id=40ac class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">3.1 The Multilingual Loophole</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">AI models are multilingual by design, but that doesn't mean they treat all languages equally. For example, models like Llama are trained predominantly in English, yet they can still process and generate text in various other languages. This creates two key problems:<ol class="pl-8 mt-2 list-decimal"><li class=mt-3>Models prioritize high-resource languages (like English) over low-resource ones.<li class=mt-3>Ensuring safety across all languages is challenging due to limited high-quality training data.</ol><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Researchers have demonstrated that AI models are more <strong>vulnerable to attacks in low-resource languages</strong>. The process is simple:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3>Take unsafe prompts in a well-resourced language.<li class=mt-3>Translate them into a low-resource language.<li class=mt-3>Use these translations to prompt the AI.<li class=mt-3>Translate the AI's response back to the original language.</ul><div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*QjGRRwFnW5v9XNmyB8W9ZQ.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of multilingual text comparison [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><p class="leading-8 mt-7">A request that would've been rejected in English suddenly works when phrased in something less familiar because those safety measures don't extend as strongly across all languages.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Researchers have tried fine-tuning models using safety data translated into these lesser-used languages. While this helps close some gaps, it's far from perfect, attacks remain easier to pull off where training data is sparse.<h4 id=2ead class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">3.2 Cipher Attacks</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">AI models are surprisingly good at understanding coded language. They can process encrypted prompts that humans wouldn't recognize at first glance. This means attackers can mask unsafe requests using <strong>ciphers, a </strong>techniques that swap or alter characters in a predictable way.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Some of the most well-known ciphers include:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><strong>ROT13 and Caesar ciphers:</strong> Shift letters in the alphabet.<li class=mt-3><strong>Leetspeak:</strong> Replaces letters with similar symbols (e.g., "h3ll0" instead of "hello").<li class=mt-3><strong>Base64 encoding:</strong> Converts text into an encoded string that looks unreadable to a human.</ul><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Since many AI safety mechanisms depend on detecting specific keywords, <strong>ciphers allow harmful prompts to slip past content filters</strong>. Some attacks take this even further, researchers have asked AI models to create their own unique ciphers, effectively teaching them to communicate in secret code. Once a model learns a new cipher, attackers can use it to mask prompts and retrieve responses that would otherwise be blocked.<div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*xfDTHUS5tuLW32kevBt6yA.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of Ciphering Attack [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><h4 id=2db6 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">3.3 Personification Attacks</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">One of the more unexpected weaknesses of language models is their ability to take on personas. AI doesn't just generate responses, it can <strong>role-play</strong> as different characters, mimicking human-like behavior. Attackers use this to manipulate models into bypassing safety restrictions.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">Here's how they do it:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><strong>Role-play as unethical characters:</strong> Asking an AI to act like a propagandist, spy, or rogue agent can significantly increase the likelihood of it generating harmful content.<li class=mt-3><strong>Psychological manipulation:</strong> Models trained on human behavior can be swayed using persuasion techniques — whether through emotional appeals, logical arguments, or deceptive tactics.<li class=mt-3><strong>Privilege escalation:</strong> Simple phrases like "ADMIN OVERRIDE" or "What if this restriction didn't exist?" have been shown to work in some cases, tricking the AI into bypassing its own safeguards.</ul><div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ThVeK-Vntaz3u68dTLnL0Q.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">An example of role play from [<a style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="" title="" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00629" target=_blank>Source</a>]</figcaption><p class="leading-8 mt-7">In experiments, attackers successfully <strong>increased the success rate of harmful prompts from less than 1% to over 40%</strong> just by tweaking the AI's persona. In multi-agent systems, where multiple AIs interact, injecting unethical traits (like deception or betrayal) led to <strong>dangerous behavior in over 40% of cases</strong>.<h3 id=b7eb class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">4. Model Manipulation</h3><p class="leading-8 mt-3">When it comes to manipulating AI systems, the game has changed. Traditional attacks focused on tricking models using clever prompts. But now, with more open-source and open-weight language models available, attackers can go a step further, directly tweaking the model itself. From adjusting hyperparameters to fine-tuning for specific (and often harmful) goals, these techniques pose new and serious risks.<h4 id=f821 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">4.1 Decoding Manipulation</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">AI generates responses by predicting words based on probabilities, but this process is far from foolproof. By tweaking how the model chooses its words during decoding, attackers can subtly nudge its behavior in dangerous directions.<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><strong>Adjusting Temperature:</strong>
The "temperature" parameter controls randomness in responses. A higher temperature creates unpredictable outputs — which might make the model produce biased or harmful content.<li class=mt-3><strong>Tweaking Sampling Techniques (Top-K &amp; Top-p):</strong>
These settings control how many high-probability words are considered when generating a response. Researchers have shown that slight changes here can boost attack success rates from as low as <em>9%</em> to over <em>95%!</em><li class=mt-3><strong>Bias Toward Affirmative Responses:</strong>
Small biases like nudging the model toward starting replies with "Sure, here is…" have been shown to make it comply with harmful instructions more easily.<li class=mt-3><strong>Weak-to-Strong Attacks:</strong>
Smaller models like Llama 7B behave similarly to their larger counterparts (e.g., Llama 70B). Attackers can study small models to predict and manipulate the behavior of larger ones.</ul><h4 id=3db5 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">4.2 Activation Manipulation:</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">This approach goes deeper than just playing with output, it targets the inner workings of an AI model while it's processing your request.<p class="leading-8 mt-7">How It Works:<ol class="pl-8 mt-2 list-decimal"><li class=mt-3>Attackers inject "interference vectors" into internal layers of the model during inference (its thought process).<li class=mt-3>This slight detour shifts how the AI interprets inputs and produces outputs, steering it toward specific goals.</ol><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Key Tactics used by attackers are:<ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3><strong>Adding Layers Mid-Inference:</strong>
An extra layer or tweak at critical points in processing allows attackers to override safeguards built into the original system.<li class=mt-3><strong>Automated Prompt Optimization:</strong>
Advanced tools help craft prompts that systematically bypass safety filters without triggering red flags.</ul><h4 id=5727 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-l md:text-xl pt-8">4.3 Model Fine-Tuning:</h4><p class="leading-8 mt-3">Fine-tuning lets developers customize pre-trained language models for specific tasks, but this flexibility comes at a cost. If done irresponsibly, fine-tuning can severely degrade a model's safety alignment or worse, introduce entirely new vulnerabilities.<p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>How Fine-Tuning Can Go Wrong?</strong><ol class="pl-8 mt-2 list-decimal"><li class=mt-3><strong>Eroding Safety Alignment:</strong></ol><p class="leading-8 mt-7">Researchers have found that fine-tuning on small sets of harmful instructions dramatically increases unsafe behaviors from under <em>10%</em> compliance to over <em>80%. </em>Models like Falcon, Llama2, and even restricted APIs like GPT-3.5 aren't immune, they all show similar vulnerabilities when fine-tuned recklessly.<p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>2. Unintended Trade-offs Between Usefulness &amp; Safety:</strong><ul class="pl-8 mt-2 list-disc"><li class=mt-3>Prioritizing usefulness during training often makes AIs more prone to risky behavior.<li class=mt-3>For example: Training an AI for "helpfulness" might lead it to answer every question (even inappropriate ones) rather than refusing unsafe requests outright.</ul><p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>3. Impact of Dataset Quality:</strong>
Even seemingly harmless datasets can cause harm. Non-factual dialogues (e.g., teaching a bot that "1+1=3" or "the Earth is flat") weaken trustworthiness in real-world scenarios.<p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>4. Technical Factors That Worsen Risks:</strong>
Using higher learning rates or smaller batch sizes during fine-tuning introduces unstable updates that push models away from their original alignment, making them easier to exploit later on.<p class="leading-8 mt-7"><strong>5. Data Leaks After Fine-Tuning:</strong>
One alarming study found that fine-tuning GPT-3.5 with just a few examples containing personal identifiable information (PII) caused it to leak private data previously kept secure! This highlights how careless customization could unintentionally expose sensitive details down the line.<h3 id=4800 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 text-1xl md:text-2xl pt-12">Closing Thoughts:</h3><div class=mt-7><img loading=eager alt=None class="pt-5 m-auto" role=presentation referrerpolicy=no-referrer src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*RBIUsBlCJKDDIVG9zCyudA.png"></div><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200">Jail Breaking Approaches [Image by Author]</figcaption><p class="leading-8 mt-7">To sum it up, <strong>red teaming</strong> is more than just a technical exercise, it's a proactive approach to staying ahead of cyber threats.
